## Introduction
Cipherise does away with passwords and usernames, giving your customers an easy, secure
login with their mobile device. With a simple, quick scan of a WaveCode, they can achieve 
multi-factor authentication in a single action.

 * Move towards a passwordless experience for your customers.
 * No more complicated passwords and usernames.
 * A simple, fast experience that is consistent across multiple services.
 * No more credential sharing.
 
By design Cipherise decentralises critical information (identity, credentials and critical 
data). Each user's credentials are encrypted and stored in a secure enclave on their personal
device. The credentials are never stored elsewhere or transmitted through a browser. This 
protects your customers' data and digital identity.

 * All Cipherise authentication transactions are decentralised and completed on a user's mobile phone.
 * Credentials are stored locally on the user's phone in encrypted form, not centrally with the service provider.
 * Credentials are never transmitted or stored outside of the user's phone.
