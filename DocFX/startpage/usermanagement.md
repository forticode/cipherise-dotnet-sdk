### User Management
In order to interact with Cipherise, a user must be enrolled to a service. This 
interaction is the key point in which the trust relationship is established. Future authentications
rely on the trust established at enrolment time. For a service that is binding a secure profile to 
their Cipherise enrolment, a secure environment must be considered. For example, adding Cipherise
to an existing profile in a site may require the user to be logged in. If Cipherise is being used
for physical access, it could require being present in the physical environment for enrolment 
binding to be accepted. Alternatively, an SMS could also be sent from a profile to the owner's 
device.

Some services need not require a personalised account, and it may be sufficient to offer the 
instantaneous creation of an anonymous account, simply by the scanning of a WaveEnrol code.
