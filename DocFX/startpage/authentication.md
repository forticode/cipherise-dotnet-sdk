### Authentications

Once a user is enrolled to a Cipherise service, authentication is then allowed.
Cipherise Authentication is bi-directional, meaning that the Cipherise service will verify the
user's device and the user's device will verify the Cipherise service. 
Authentication can be used in a variety of ways. It can be simple access control, physical or 
digital but it can also be part of a workflow. Workflows could include financial 
transaction approval, manager approval or multiple party approval for example.

There are two types of authentication, Wave and Push. Push authentication is targeted to a 
specific user, where Wave authentication is performed by displaying a WaveCode that can be 
scanned by a user. Once authenticated, the Service Provider will be informed of the user's 
username.
