### Service Management

The Service Provider can query a Cipherise Server for information to determine 
the supported functionality:
 * [Querying a Cipherise server](#QueryCS)

For users to be able to enrol and authenticate to a Service Provider one or more 
services need to be created:
  * [Creating new services](#NewService)
  * [Revoking services](#RevokeService)
